Cool Wiki App!

I got the basic functionality working. With this app you can create an account, login and search wikipedia for the extract of a page.
This page can then be saved to a personal database which can be viewed at a later time.
The database page is a listview with all the names of the pages the user added. 
clicking on a name shows the content of the extract. Also a delete button is there to delete the record from database.
